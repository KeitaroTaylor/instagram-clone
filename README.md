Created an app that has the core functionality of Instagram.

Includes a profile when an account is made,
the ability to make posts on your profile,
a page specifically for an image you clicked on that displays comments (when logged in),
the ability to comment on a specific post clicked on (when logged in),
the ability to view an account's profile when clicking on their username (when logged in)
